1. Project Description
    - DATS Chess is an AI chess engine with an associated web application.  The DATS chess engine is made in accordance with the Universal Chess Interface and is capable of communicating with current engines such as Stockfish, AlphaZero, etc.

1. Summary of Hours and Justification
    - AJ Delcimmuto: 50 hours -> designed new features for the front end application. Built a websocket that is used to send messages between the front end and the chess engine. Reconfigured the engine to add support for asyncronous pipe messages from the web socket.
    - Chris Tatlonghari: 50 hours -> Built a strong basis for the engine architecture. The engine is completely custom built from the ground up. It is also able to play a full game against itself. It is built using UCI, which is a chess communication protocol that enables communication with many different GUIs.
    - Joe Snider: 50 hours -> Began building out our database architecture to store user information and game history.
    - Rouba Al-Khasawneh: 50 hours -> Began building key features for the front end.

The Final Design Report Summary of Hours:

  - AJ Delcimmuto: 100 hours -> Designed and built the basis of the web application. Implemented game logic and chess board UI. Also, built new features for the front end application. Built a websocket that is used to send messages between the front end and the chess engine. Reconfigured the engine to add support for asyncronous pipe messages from the web socket.
  - Chris Tatlonghari: 100 Hours -> Research a basic structure for the chess engine. Also built a strong basis for the engine. The engine is completely custom built from the ground up. It is also able to play a full game against itself. It is built using UCI, which is a chess communication protocol that enables communication with many different GUIs.
  - Joe Snider: 100 hours -> Research basic and common machine learning practices. Began building out our database architecture to store user information and game history.
  - Rouba Al-Khasawneh: 100 hours -> Research on designing the layout of the web application. Began building key features for the front end.
